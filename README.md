# significance-in-plots
This template allows you to conduct ANOVA and Tukey-HSD post-hoc tests, and extract the significance codes from the statistical output for inclusion into bar plots. 

Data for import should be in a .csv file, and in the same folder as the template. The template uses the mock data included in the R-workshop repository, but you can read in .csv data from your own data. See comments in the code for more specific instructions on how to manipulate the code and create plots.
